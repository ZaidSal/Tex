\chapter*{Abstract}
Yarmouk University, like many other universities, 
has a large campus with many buildings and facilities. 
The university's network infrastructure is sort of outdated and does not provide 
adequate coverage for all areas, and connecting to the web servers in the university from outside can 
be a headache when more people are trying to access them.
This project aims to enhance the network connectivity for Yarmouk University 
by using Fortinet products. 

\textbf{Fortinet} is a network security company that provides relatively cheap, modern, and easy-to-use and maintain products that can also easily provide a great level of network security through different measures.
Fortinet relies heavily on the use of \textbf{FortiGate} devices, which are firewalls that can be used to secure the network, as well as managing any Fortinet device connected to it.
This project will implement a Hierarchical networking design for the main university building and another one for the South building, and connect them using \textbf{Site-To-Site VPN} to provide a secure connection between the two buildings.
This project will also include a protection layer for the data center in the university using \textbf{DMZ} where the DMZ will include web servers and any service that is ok to be public.
The project will also implement a Web Application Firewall to protect the web servers in the university from any attacks.
One of the main focuses of this project is to provide redundancy and load balancing for the network using 
various technologies like \textbf{SD-WAN} and link monitoring for Internet connectivity and \textbf{High Availability (HA)} for FortiGate redundancy.
FortiGates will also provide services like \textbf{Web Filtering} and \textbf{Application Control} to control the network traffic and prevent any unwanted traffic from entering the network.
We will be using various Fortinet products like FortisSwitches, FortiAPs, FortiAnalyzer, and FortiManager to provide a complete solution for the university's network infrastructure.

\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Problem Statement and Purpose}
This Project aims to enhance university networking by making it more secure, 
reliable, easier and cheaper to obtain and maintain, and provide a better user experience for the students and staff.

\section{Background}
Yarmouk University holds more than 41,000 students and has many schools and departments \cite{YU} , yet, the network infrastructure is outdated and does not provide adequate coverage for all areas, and connecting to the web servers in the university from outside can be a nightmare during peak times. For example, system responsiveness during registration on the \date{19th of May, 2024} was not that great, especially that only those who are expected to graduate can register.
\section{Aims and objectives}
The main aim of this project is to enhance the network connectivity for Yarmouk University by using Fortinet products. The objectives of this project are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implement a Hierarchical networking design for the main university campus and another one for the South campus.
    \item Connect the two campuses using Site-To-Site VPN to provide a secure connection between the two campuses.
    \item Implement a protection layer for the data center in the university using demilitarized zone (DMZ).
    \item Implement a Web Application Firewall to protect the web servers in the university from any attacks.
    \item Provide redundancy and load balancing for the network using various technologies like software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN) and link monitoring for Internet connectivity.
    \item Provide High Availability (HA) for FortiGate redundancy.
    \item Provide services like Web Filtering and Application Control to control the network traffic and prevent any unwanted traffic from entering the network.
    \item Use various Fortinet products like FortiSwitches, FortiAPs, FortiAnalyzer, and FortiManager to provide a complete solution for the university's network infrastructure.
\end{itemize}

Fortinet is a network security company, based in California, USA. It provides relatively cheap, modern, and easy-to-use and maintain products that can also easily provide a great level of network security through different measures. Fortinet relies heavily on the use of FortiGate devices, which are firewalls that can be used to secure the network, as well as managing any Fortinet device connected to it. Fortinet also provides other products like FortiSwitches, FortiAPs, FortiAnalyzer, and FortiManager to provide a complete solution for the network infrastructure \cite{FortinetAbtus}. 
We suggest converting to Fortinet products for its great security and ease of use and maintenance, as well as it being cheaper relative to Cisco and other competitors. \cite{FNvsCISCO}

\chapter{Background}
\section{Overview and context}

Yarmouk University has outdated network infrastructure that struggles to serve the large student body and academic and technical staff over two large campuses. The network lacks redundancy and load balancing. The current network infrastructure is not suitable for the size and complexity of the university. In our modern interconnected world, a reliable and secure network is essential for the university to function effectively; a wide-spanning WiFi network is vital for students and staff to access the internet and university resources. Additionally, computer labs need a dependable backbone to function properly.
\section{Target Market - Yarmouk University}
Yarmouk University is a public university in Jordan, located in Irbid. It was established in 1976 and has grown to become one of the largest universities in Jordan. The university offers a wide range of undergraduate and postgraduate programs in various fields, including engineering, science, arts, and humanities. Yarmouk University has a large student body, with over 41,000 students enrolled in various programs. The university has multiple campuses, including the main campus and the south campus, which are located in different parts of Irbid. The university has a diverse student population, with students from different backgrounds and nationalities. The university is known for its high-quality education and research programs, and it has a strong reputation in the region. Yarmouk University is committed to providing its students with a supportive and inclusive learning environment, and it is constantly striving to improve its facilities and services to meet the needs of its students and staff. \cite{YU}

\section{Potential Ethical and Environmental Issues}
Yarmouk University use solar energy for its power needs, and the network infrastructure is not energy-intensive. The project will not have a significant environmental impact. The project will not have any ethical issues, as it aims to improve the network infrastructure for the benefit of the university community \cite{Solar}. Figure \ref{fig:YUMap} shows that Yarmouk University installed solar panels across the campus.

\section{Other Approaches}
Most organizations utilize CISCO systems since it was ubiquitous in the networking industry until mid 2010s. CISCO provided unmatched stability and consistency, but at the expense of cost and high level of expertise needed to setup and maintain, as it mainly relies on commands. CISCO's monopoly caused its innovation to stagnate, and prices to go up. They only offered basic systems, especially when it came to firewalls.\cite{FNvsCISCO} \cite{CISCOInntoFin}

\section{Design Overview}
\subsection{Design Description}
The design of the project will focus on enhancing the network connectivity for Yarmouk University by using Fortinet products. The project will implement a Hierarchical networking design for the main university campus and another one for the South campus, and connect them using Site-To-Site VPN to provide a secure connection between the two buildings. The project will also include a protection layer for the data center in the university using DMZ where the DMZ will include web servers and any service that is ok to be public. The project will also implement a Web Application Firewall to protect the web servers in the university from any attacks. One of the main focuses of this project is to provide redundancy and load balancing for the network using various technologies like SD-WAN and link monitoring for Internet connectivity and High Availability (HA) for FortiGate redundancy. FortiGates will also provide services like Web Filtering and Application Control to control the network traffic and prevent any unwanted traffic from entering the network We will be using various Fortinet products like FortiSwitches, FortiAPs, FortiAnalyzer, and FortiManager to provide a complete solution for the university's network infrastructure.

\section{Design Details}
\subsection{Design Specifications}
This project requires:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Two server rooms (which may already exist), equipped with heavy-duty cooling, uninterruptible power supplies, and a backup generator.
    \item A large number of Fortinet devices, including FortiGate firewalls, FortiSwitches, and FortiAPs (both indoor and outdoor for enhanced WiFi coverage).
    \item Extra server racks for redundant devices.
    \item A team of network engineers and security experts for regular maintenance and vulnerability testing of the network infrastructure.
    \item At least two high-speed internet connections from different ISPs to minimize internet outage time.
    \item Cabling: fiber connections for high-speed links between core devices (e.g., FortiGates to core FortiSwitches or servers) and CAT6A for inter-switch connectivity and access points. CAT6 cabling will be used for end-users and terminal devices.
\end{enumerate}
\newpage
\section{Design Process}
This project will include countless technologies that will enhance networking around Yarmouk University, many of which is provided by Fortinet.
\subsection{Hierarchical Networking Design}
The project will implement a Hierarchical networking design for the main university campus and another one for the South campus. The Hierarchical design will include Core, Distribution, and Access layers. The Core layer will be responsible for high-speed switching and routing between different parts of the network. The Distribution layer will be responsible for routing between different VLANs and providing access to the core layer. The Access layer will be responsible for connecting end-user devices to the network. The Hierarchical design will provide scalability, redundancy, and security for the network infrastructure. It will also allow for modularity as any future changes is easier to manage through the separation of the network into different layers.\cite{HeirNWDes}

\subsection{FortiGate, a Next-Generation Firewall}
\subsubsection{Firewall vs Router}
In the past, the main device that allowed for inter-network and inter-VLAN routing was a router, a router would usually observe the destination IP of a packet, and based on a routing table, a router would decide where to send the packet. On-premise firewalls where introduced as a replacement for routers as they provide additional security features, such as what traffic to allow, what IPs or ports to block, posing limitations on end devices as to who they can communicate with and so on. Firewalls are usually used to protect the network from the outside world, while routers are used to connect different networks together. Firewalls started replacing routers especially since the internet expanded for more people, more hackers where found where they imposed new ways to access networks and devices that they should not be accessing. Table \ref{tab:router vs firewall} shows the difference between routers and firewalls. \cite{FWvsRout}

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Feature} & \textbf{Router} & \textbf{Firewall} \\ \hline
    Layer & 3 & 4 \\ \hline
    Routing & Yes & Yes \\ \hline
    Security & Limited features & Yes \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Router vs Firewall}
    \label{tab:router vs firewall}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Legacy vs Next-Generation Firewalls}
Legacy firewalls are firewalls that operate at the network layer (Layer 4) of the OSI model and provide basic packet filtering based on source ports and IPs and stateful inspection, which tracks the packets state to determine if a suspicious activity such as a DOS attack is occurring or not. Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs) are firewalls that operate at the application layer (Layer 7) of the OSI model and provide advanced features like web filtering, which determines what website a certain user is blocked from visiting, intrusion prevention systems, which would block any suspicious activity that is trying to access any valuable devices, servers or data for stealing or damaging them, anti-malware, which detects any malware through behaviors and any signature that would point out that this packet is a malware, and managing external services, for example, forcing safe-search on google such that no inappropriate search results appear, and track what users do on the web. NGFWs are more advanced and provide better security than legacy firewalls. Table \ref{tab:firewalls} shows the difference between legacy and next-generation firewalls. \cite{legtoNGFW}
Figures \ref{fig:legacyFW} and \ref{fig:NGFW} show an example of both a legacy firewall from CISCO and a next-generation firewall from Fortinet.

%table
\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Feature} & \textbf{Legacy Firewall} & \textbf{Next-Generation Firewall} \\ \hline
    Layer & 4 & 7 \\ \hline
    Packet Filtering & Yes & Yes \\ \hline
    Stateful Inspection & Yes & Yes \\ \hline
    Application Awareness & No & Yes \\ \hline
    Intrusion Prevention & No & Yes \\ \hline
    Web Filtering & No & Yes \\ \hline
    Anti-Malware & No & Yes \\ \hline
    SSL Inspection & No & Yes \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Legacy vs Next-Generation Firewalls}
    \label{tab:firewalls}
\end{table}
Next-generation firewalls (NGFWs), particularly FortiGate devices, emphasize the importance of comprehensive policy management to enhance security. In FortiGate NGFWs, virtually all configurations, including routing and advanced security features, are implemented through security policies. This approach centralizes control, allowing administrators to define, enforce, and monitor rules within a single, cohesive framework. By managing routing within policies, FortiGate ensures that traffic is scrutinized and controlled based on security parameters before it is allowed to proceed, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential breaches. This method of embedding most functionalities within a policy framework enhances security by maintaining consistent and granular control over network traffic, ensuring that all actions align with the organization's security posture and compliance requirements \cite{Policies}. Figure \ref{fig:FortiGatePolicy} shows an example of FortiGate Policy Management page on the FortiOS configuration page.

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/Policy.png}
    \caption{FortiGate Policy Management}
    \label{fig:FortiGatePolicy}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Switches}
%basic switch functionality, l2 and l3 switches, and how they are used in the network
Switches are devices that connect devices together in a network, they operate at either layer 2 or layer 3 of the OSI model, and they use MAC addresses to determine where to send packets. Layer 2 switches are used to connect devices together in a network, while Layer 3 can switch between different VLANs. Layer 3 switches can also perform routing functions, and they are used to connect different VLANs together. Switches are used to provide high-speed connectivity between devices in a network and to reduce network congestion. They are used to create a network that is fast, reliable, and secure. This project will utilize the use of layer 2 switching services as any routing must be done at the firewall to ensure security \cite{switch}. Figure \ref{fig:FortiSwitch} shows an example of a FortiSwitch device from Fortinet.
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/FortiSwitch.png}
    \caption{FortiSwitch from Fortinet \cite{FSIMG}}
    \label{fig:FortiSwitch}
\end{figure} 


\subsection{VLANs}
%what are VLANs, how they are used in the network
VLANs are Virtual Local Area Networks, they are used to separate different parts of a network into different segments, they are used to provide security, scalability, and flexibility to a network. VLANs are used to separate different departments in an organization, different floors in a building, or different parts of a campus. VLANs are used to reduce network congestion and improve network performance. VLANs are used to provide flexibility by allowing devices to be moved between different parts of a network without changing their IP addresses. This project will use VLANs to separate different parts of the network, however, VLAN managment is one of the main things that is discussed with the upper management like CEOs, presidents or who can represent them, since they are the ones who envision how the splitting should be. \cite{VLAN}

\subsection{Wireless Access Points}
%what are WAPs, how they are used in the network, and indoors vs outdoors
Wireless Access Points (WAPs) are devices that allow devices to connect to a network wirelessly. They are used to provide WiFi coverage in a network. WAPs are used to provide wireless connectivity to devices that do not have a wired connection, such as mobile phones. WAPs are used to provide mobility to users by allowing them to connect to the network from anywhere in the coverage area. WAPs can be used indoors or outdoors, depending on the coverage area required. Indoor WAPs are used to provide WiFi coverage inside buildings, while outdoor WAPs are used to provide WiFi coverage outside buildings. This project heavily aims to improve WiFi quality thus will use both indoor and outdoor WAPs to provide WiFi coverage to the main university campus and the South campus \cite{FortiAP}.
Figure \ref{fig:FortiAP} shows an example of a FortiAP device from Fortinet. 
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/AP.png}
    \caption{FortiAP from Fortinet \cite{FAPIMG}}
    \label{fig:FortiAP}
\end{figure}

\subsection{NATting}
%what is NATting, Natting types comparison, how it is used in the network
Network Address Translation (NAT) is a process that allows devices on a private network to communicate with devices on a public network. NAT is used to translate the private IP addresses of devices on a private network to a public IP. NAT is used to conserve public IP addresses by allowing multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address. NAT is used to provide security by hiding the internal network structure from the outside world. There are three types of NAT: Static NAT, Dynamic NAT, and Port Address Translation (PAT). Static NAT maps a private IP address to a public IP address on a one-to-one basis. Dynamic NAT maps a private IP address to a public IP address from a pool of public IP addresses. PAT maps multiple private IP addresses to a single public IP address utilizing different port numbers. This project will use PAT to allow devices on the private network to communicate with the public network \cite{NATTing}. Figure \ref{fig:NAT} shows an example of NAT configuration on a FortiGate device.

\subsection{SD-WAN \& Link Monitoring}
The project will use Software-Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN) technology to provide redundancy and load balancing for the network. SD-WAN technology allows for the dynamic routing of traffic over multiple links based on the quality of the link and the traffic type. This will ensure that critical traffic is always routed over the best link and that the network is always available. SD-WAN technology will also allow for link monitoring and failover, so that if one link fails, traffic is automatically rerouted over another link. This will provide a high level of availability for the network and ensure that users always have access to the resources they need. SD-WAN is mainly used when connecting to the internet, so what sites usually do is to subscribe to more than one ISP, for example, a company would subscribe to both Zain and Umniah, and apply SD-WAN in a way that allows for a device in the network to connect to the outside world through Zain, and another device to be connected through Umniah, thus load balancing session-wise is applied. \cite{SDWAN}
%link monitoring
Link monitoring is a feature that allows the network administrator to monitor the quality of the links in the network. Link monitoring can be used to monitor the latency, packet loss, and jitter of the links. This information can be used to determine the best link for routing traffic and to ensure that the network is always available. Link monitoring can also be used to detect link failures and automatically reroute traffic over another link. This will provide a high level of availability for the network and ensure that users always have access to the resources they need. Link monitoring is used in conjunction with SD-WAN technology to provide redundancy and load balancing for the network. \cite{LinkMonitor}

\subsection{High Availability (HA)}
High Availability (HA) is a feature that allows the network administrator to ensure that the network is always available. HA can be used to provide redundancy for critical devices in the network, such as firewalls and switches. HA can be used to ensure that if one device fails, another device takes over automatically. This will provide a high level of availability for the network and ensure that users always have access to the resources they need. HA can also be used to provide load balancing for the network, so that traffic is distributed evenly across multiple devices. This will ensure that the network is always available and that users always have access to the resources they need. HA is used in conjunction with SD-WAN technology to provide redundancy and load balancing for the network. Figure \ref{fig:HA} shows an example of HA configuration on a FortiGate device.
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/HA.png}
    \caption{FortiGate HA Configuration}
    \label{fig:HA}
\end{figure}
\newpage
As the above topology shows, a link between the 2 HA devices known as the heartbeat is required to ensure that the slave knows when to takeover when the master fails. Devices in HA mode ping each other in regular intervals and wait for a response from the other device. If the other device replies, things proceed as is, if there is no reply to the ping, another ping is sent to check if the device really failed or not, if still there is no reply, and the slave is being problematic, the master just operates normally and warns the administration that slave might have failed, if the master is the one that is not responding, slave takes over, advertises itself as the gateway to the switches until the issue is fixed, then the master will take over again and advertise itself as the gateway. It is recommended to have a redundant heartbeat, in an active-passive mode; if we had only 1 link and it failed, the slave will assume that the master failed, advertising itself as the gateway, meaning that 2 FortiGates assume that they are the the active gateway, causing confusion for the core switches and thus the site goes down. This project will utilize HA for the FortiGates in an active-passive mode, as this will increase the life-span of the overall topology, lowering costs in the long run, and minimizing down-time. \cite{HA} \cite{HA2}

\subsection{DMZ}
%what is a DMZ, how it is used in the network, technical details on how it works and its purpose in the project
A Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) is a network segment that is used to provide a layer of security between the internal network and the external network. The DMZ is used to host public-facing services, such as web servers and email servers. Any storage servers is located in the internal network and is accessed through the DMZ. The DMZ is isolated from the internal network and the external network, and traffic is only allowed to flow between the DMZ and the internal network through specific security policies. The DMZ is used to protect the internal network from attacks that originate from the external network. The DMZ is also used to provide a layer of security for public-facing services, so that if an attacker compromises a public-facing service, they cannot gain access to the internal network. When an external traffic enters the FortiGate, it is routed immediately to the service it needs in the DMZ, and any access needed to the storage servers or a device inside the network is done by the servers themselves requesting access to the required device in the network, ensuring that only the permitted requests are allowed, thus protecting any sensitive data or device that shouldnt be accessed or have limited access. This process is also known as port fowarding, since the request by the DMZ servers to access the internal network uses different port number from that of the request done by the user using the web servers from outside (he would usually access the web server with number 80 for HTTP or 443 for HTTPS). This project will implement a DMZ for parts of the data center in the university, where the DMZ will host web servers and any other public-facing services. \cite{DMZ} 
\subsection{Site-to-Site VPN}
%what is a site-to-site VPN, how it is used in the network, technical details on how it works, ssl vs ipsec, why use ipsec doe our project and its purpose in the project.
A Site-to-Site Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a method used to connect two or more networks over the internet securely. It allows different locations of an organization to communicate with each other as if they were on the same local network, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality over the public internet.
In a network, a Site-to-Site VPN is typically used to connect branch offices to a central office, creating a cohesive internal network. This setup is essential for organizations with multiple geographic locations, enabling secure and efficient communication between sites. For instance, a company with a head office and remote branch offices can use a Site-to-Site VPN to connect all locations into a single network, ensuring seamless access to shared resources.
A Site-to-Site VPN establishes a secure and encrypted connection between VPN gateways at each site. The process involves the following steps \cite{Site2Site}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Encryption: Data is encrypted before it is transmitted over the internet to ensure confidentiality.
    \item Tunneling: Data packets are encapsulated within another packet to create a secure tunnel between the sites.
    \item Authentication: Both endpoints authenticate each other to establish a trusted connection.
    \item Decryption: Once the data reaches the destination, it is decrypted for use within the local network.
\end{itemize}
The VPN gateway at each site handles the encryption, tunneling, and decryption processes, ensuring secure communication between the networks.
There are two primary types of VPN protocols used in Site-to-Site VPNs: SSL VPN and IPsec VPN. SSL VPN operates at the application layer, using SSL/TLS for encryption and authentication, while IPsec VPN operates at the network layer, using the IPsec protocol suite for security features. Table \ref{tab:vpns} provides a comparison of SSL VPN and IPsec VPN \cite{IPSec} \cite{IPSecvsSSL} 
\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Feature} & \textbf{SSL VPN} & \textbf{IPsec VPN} \\ \hline
    Layer of Operation & Application Layer & Network Layer \\ \hline
    Security & Uses SSL/TLS for encryption and authentication & Uses IPsec protocol suite for encryption, integrity, and authentication \\ \hline
    Setup Complexity & Easier to set up, often requires just a web browser & More complex, requires configuration on both client and server \\ \hline
    Performance & Generally slower due to higher overheads & Typically faster due to lower overheads \\ \hline
    Usage Scenarios & Remote access for individual users & Site-to-Site connections and remote access \\ \hline
    Firewall Traversal & Better at traversing firewalls and NAT & May have issues with firewalls and NAT \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Comparison of SSL VPN and IPsec VPN}
    \label{tab:vpns}
\end{table}
For our project, which involves connecting the main campus and the south campus, IPsec is the preferred choice due to several reasons:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Security: IPsec provides robust security features, including strong encryption and comprehensive authentication mechanisms.
    \item Performance: IPsec typically offers better performance and lower latency, which is crucial for maintaining efficient communication between campuses.
    \item Compatibility: IPsec is widely supported across various devices and platforms, ensuring seamless integration with existing network infrastructure.
\end{itemize}
The primary purpose of using IPsec in this project is to establish a secure, reliable, and high-performance connection between the main campus and the south campus. This connection will enable both campuses to share resources, access centralized services, and communicate effectively, thereby enhancing the overall operational efficiency of the organization.


\subsection{VRRP in Core Switches}
%what is VRRP, how it is used in the network, technical details on how it works, and its purpose in the project, HOW HALF OF THE VLANS WILL BE VRRPd to half of the vlans and the other half to the other half of the vlans
Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) is a network protocol that provides high availability for core switches on a LAN. VRRP allows multiple switches to work together as a single virtual router, providing redundancy and failover in case one switch fails. VRRP works by electing a master switch that handles all traffic, while the other routers act as backups. If the master switch fails, one of the backup switches takes over as the master, ensuring continuous network operation. VRRP is commonly used in core switches to provide redundancy and failover in case of failure of one of the switches. In this project, VRRP will be used in the core switches to provide redundancy for the network. Half of the VLANs will be VRRP'd to one of the core switches, and the other half will be VRRP'd to the other core switch. This will ensure loadbalancing and parallelism. If one core switch fails, the other core switch can take over and handle the traffic for all VLANs. This will provide a high level of availability for the network and ensure that users always have access to the resources they need. \cite{VRRP}
\subsection{Internal Servers}
\subsubsection{DNS}
%what is DNS, how it is used in the network, technical details on how it works, and its purpose in the project
Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or any resource connected to the internet or a private network. It translates domain names into IP addresses, which are required for locating and identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols. DNS is used to map human-readable domain names to IP addresses, allowing users to access websites, send emails, and connect to other network resources using easy-to-remember names. DNS servers store and manage domain name records, including IP addresses, aliases, and other information necessary for routing network traffic. In this project, internal DNS servers will be deployed to resolve domain names within the university's network, ensuring seamless communication between devices and services. The DNS servers will be configured to handle internal domain names and provide name resolution for local resources, enhancing network connectivity and accessibility. \cite{DNS}

\subsubsection{Traffic Shaping}
Traffic shaping (also called Quality of Service in CISCO) is a feature that allows the network administrator to control the flow of traffic in the network. Traffic shaping can be used to prioritize certain types of traffic over others and to limit the bandwidth of certain types of traffic. This can be used to ensure that critical traffic, such as voice and video traffic, always has enough bandwidth and that non-critical traffic, such as file downloads, does not consume all the available bandwidth. Traffic shaping can also be used to control the flow of traffic between different parts of the network and to ensure that the network is always available. Traffic Shaping can also limit internet speed for a certain user/VLAN, meaning that for example, you can limit any traffic for a certain source IP to get a max speed of 12Mbps. This project will use traffic shaping to allow for a smoother experience when connecting to the internet in the university, as well as give more bandwidth to the Computer Engineering department as we deserve it.
%Types of Traffic Shaping
There are two types of traffic shaping: Per-IP traffic shaping and Shared traffic shaping. Per-IP traffic shaping limits the bandwidth for each individual IP address, while Shared traffic shaping limits the bandwidth for all IP addresses in a group. Per-IP traffic shaping is used to limit the bandwidth for specific users or devices, while Shared traffic shaping is used to limit the bandwidth for a group of users or devices. This project will use both types of traffic shaping to control the flow of traffic in the network and ensure that critical traffic always has enough bandwidth. \cite{SharedTrafficShaping} \cite{PerIPTrafficShaping}
\section{Legal Aspects}
% TODO: Talk about licensing in fortinet products, different types of licensing
Fortinet products require licensing to enable certain features and services. The project will need to purchase the necessary licenses for the Fortinet devices to ensure that all security features, updates, and support services are available. The project will also need to comply with licensing agreements and terms of use for the Fortinet products to avoid any legal issues. The project will work with Fortinet representatives to ensure that all licensing requirements are met and that the network infrastructure is properly licensed and supported.
This project will comply with all regulation and laws by the Jordanian government to ensure data security, privacy, and compliance with legal requirements. The project will also ensure that all network configurations and security policies adhere to industry best practices and standards to protect the university's network and data. The project will also follow Fortinet's guidelines and recommendations for configuring and managing Fortinet devices to ensure that the network infrastructure is secure, reliable, and efficient. 
\section{Design Constraints}

Yarmouk University is usually tight on money, so this project will try to be as cost-effective as possible. The project will also try to minimize downtime during the implementation phase to avoid disrupting the university's operations. Different models of switches and APs will be used to ensure minimum budget needed, for example, no need for high end switches for all layers, access layer switches can be a lower model than that of the core switches, and no need for high-end outdoor APs in a small room or building. Distribution of APs need to be done in a way to ensure coverage in all areas of the university, but still consider using the least number of APs possible. \cite{YUMoneyIssue}

\section{Design Standards}
The project will adhere to industry standards and best practices for network design and security. The project will follow IEEE 802 standards for networking, including Ethernet, WiFi, and other protocols. The project will also follow ISO/IEC 27001 standards for information security management to ensure that the university's network infrastructure is secure and compliant with international security standards. The project will also follow Fortinet's best practices and guidelines for configuring and managing Fortinet devices to ensure that the network is secure, reliable, and efficient. The project will also follow ITIL best practices for network management and service delivery to ensure that the network infrastructure meets the university's requirements and objectives. The project will also follow local regulations and laws to ensure that the network infrastructure complies with legal requirements and data protection regulations. The project will also follow industry standards for network design, security, and management to ensure that the network infrastructure is robust, scalable, and secure. \cite{IEEE802} \cite{ISO27001} \cite{ITIL}

\section{Design Alternatives}
MPLS is a great solution for connecting multiple sites, but it is expensive and requires a high level of expertise to set up and maintain. Site-to-Site VPN is a more cost-effective solution that provides a secure connection between two sites over the internet. It is easier to set up and maintain and provides a good level of security for most applications. For this project, we chose to use Site-to-Site VPN to connect the main campus and the south campus, as it provides a good balance between cost, security, and ease of use.
